## Features

- Rule-based file organization
- Folder-specific rules
- Support for various file actions (move, copy, rename, delete, etc.)
- Condition-based rules (file type, date, size, name, etc.)
- Easy to use CLI interface

## Installation

```bash
cargo install orderly


## Installation

To install Orderly, ensure you have Rust installed on your system. Then run the following command:

```bash
cargo install orderly
```

## Usage

Orderly uses a configuration file to define rules. Here's a basic example of how to set it up:

1. Initialize Orderly in a directory:

```bash
orderly init
```

2. Create a new rule file in the `rules` directory:

```bash
touch rules/example.yaml
```

3. Open the `example.yaml` file and add the following content:

```yaml
name: Example Rule
description: An example rule for organizing files
actions:
  - name: Move to Trash
    path: ~/.Trash
    condition:
      type: file
      size: 100MB
    action:
      type: move
      path: ~/.Trash
```

4. Run Orderly to apply the rule:

```bash
orderly run
```
